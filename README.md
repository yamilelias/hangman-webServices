# Hangman
## The Webservice Game

This is a Hangman game developed in a java Web Service, taking the random words in JSON Format from another Web Service. The IDE used for this project was **Netbeans** so a  project confiration directory is included. The project was developed to process a random word from another Web Service in the server side and then pass that word to an AngularJS application for the game functionality.

This project was originally part of an assignment for Web Applications class in Tec de Monterrey. This project was developed by me, [Yamil El√≠as](https://github.com/yamilelias). Feel free to use the code whatever you want, is licenced under [GPL-2.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).
